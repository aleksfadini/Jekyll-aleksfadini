<p>I <em>do not</em> use social medias, and I really would like feedback via email, which is a <em>decentralized</em> platform. I care so much about it, that I will explain my reasons in great detail on this page.</p>

<h1 id="a-case-against-social-medias">A Case Against Social Medias</h1>

<p>I have always felt an intutive dislike for social medias. With time, I made the conscious choice to avoid them altogether for the greater gods of my creative goals and my personal growth and happiness.</p>

<h1 id="can-an-artist-not-use-social-medias">Can an artist not use social medias?</h1>
<p>Although many friends, among them succesful artists and musicians, claim that social medias are a way to connect to like-minded individuals and to cherish an audence, Ibelieve this is not the only way to do it.
Furthermore, for me the price to pay is too high, in terms of personal space of thoughts.
My suspicion that social medias seriously interfere with our ability to do deep, meaningful work has been confirmed by Harvar computer scientist Cal Newport, as explained in much of his work.
If you are not familiar wit it, take a look at <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a>.
Cal Newport really solidified my view of social medias, happiness and creative work.</p>

<p>Finally, centralized social medias are unethical in my view, and I want to minimize my partaking into anything intrinsically evil. I look forward to new decentralized platforms.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s much easier to try something arduous if you can see others succeeding at it.
A musician I always admired artistically who also made the choice to avoid all social medias is saxophonist. music producer and painter <a href="https://www.josiahboornazian.com">Josiah Boornazian</a>.
We collaborated extensively and I am fortunate to consider him a close friend of mine.</p>

<h1 id="other-ways-to-communicate-email">Other ways to communicate: email!</h1>
<p>I see email as a superior way of comunication compared to social medias, and I answer most of the emails I receive, even if it takes a lot of time (and you might expect a delay sometime).
In particular, I answer all emails that come from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>anybody offering feedback or asking a question</li>
  <li>musicians and possible collaborators</li>
  <li>anyone involved in the digital art world</li>
  <li>anyone using SpaceEars, the one and only ear-training roguelike game that I am committed to improve every day</li>
</ul>
