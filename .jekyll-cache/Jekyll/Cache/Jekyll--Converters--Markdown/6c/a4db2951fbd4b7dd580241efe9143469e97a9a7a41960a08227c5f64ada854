<p>You can write to me using the email in the footer, or even my personal email, which is aleksfadini followed by the usual gmail dot com</p>

<p>I <em>do not</em> use social media, and I really would like feedback via email, which is a <em>decentralized</em> platform. I care so much about it, that I will explain my reasons in great detail on this page.</p>

<h1 id="a-case-against-social-media">A Case Against Social Media</h1>

<p>I have always felt an intuitive dislike for social media. With time, I made the conscious choice to avoid them altogether for the greater good of my creative goals and my personal growth and happiness.</p>

<h1 id="can-an-artist-not-use-social-media">Can an artist not use social media?</h1>
<p>Although many friends, among them successful artists and musicians, claim that social media are a way to connect to like-minded individuals and to cherish an audience, I believe this is not the only way to do it.
Furthermore, for me the price to pay is too high, in terms of personal space of thoughts.
My suspicion is that social media seriously interfere with our ability to do deep and meaningful work has been confirmed by Harvard computer scientist Cal Newport, as explained in much of his work.
If you are not familiar wit it, take a look at <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work</a>.
Cal Newport really solidified my view of social media, happiness and creative work.</p>

<p>Finally, centralized social media are unethical in my view, and I want to minimize my partaking into anything intrinsically evil. I look forward to new decentralized platforms.</p>

<h1 id="role-models">Role models</h1>
<p>Itâ€™s much easier to try something arduous if you can see others succeeding at it.
I have always admired <a href="https://www.josiahboornazian.com">Josiah Boornazian</a>, a musician who also made the artistic choice to avoid all social media. Josiah is a world-renowned saxophonist, music producer and painter.
We collaborated extensively and I am fortunate to consider him a close friend of mine.</p>

<h1 id="other-ways-to-communicate-email">Other ways to communicate: email!</h1>
<p>I see email as a superior way of communication compared to social media, and I answer most of the emails I receive, even if it takes a lot of time (be patient).
In particular, I answer all emails that come from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>anybody offering feedback or asking a question</li>
  <li>musicians and possible collaborators</li>
  <li>anyone involved in the digital art world</li>
  <li>anyone using SpaceEars, the one and only ear-training rogue-like game that I am committed to improve every day</li>
</ul>
