      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/headshot03.jpg" alt="" /></span>Alessandro’s first musical misadventure was as a self-taught musician, fascinated by jazz music. In his hometown in Italy, he studied with his first mentor,
        pianist Daniele Tione, who showed to him that what really matters in music is not the ear but the nose, and looking in the mirror Alessandro realized his great potential.</p>

      <p>With the intention of studying something useful for a change, Alessandro also pursued a career in Mathematics in the Università degli Studi di Torino, but then relocated to France to escape far away from numbers and algorythms. He completed
        his studies at the Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional de Nice, Côte d’Azur.</p>
      <p><span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/headshot04.jpg" alt="" /></span> There, he collaborated with French musicians, among them saxophonist and mentor Jean-Marc Baccarini, who introduced him to total improvisation, further
        reducing his chances to make a living out of music and make his grandma happy.</p>

      <p>In 2011, Alessandro moved to New York City, worked as a freelance pianist, toured internationally with singer Yana Bibb and graduated in Jazz Performance at the City College of New York. Under the mentorship of pianist Marc Copland,
        Alessandro developed an idea of music that is intensely groovy yet intuitive and freely improvised. </p>
      <p>This musical identity allowed Alessandro to connect with like-minded musicians and to create his own NY-based group, with which he performs regularly, showcasing new musical concepts that push the boundaries of modern jazz. This sound is
        captured in Alessandro Fadini’s debut album, “It Was A Dark And Stormy Day”, published by Freshsound New Talent. </p>
      <p>
        Alessandro has been producing digital art and paintings steadily during the last decade. His painting style is abstract, intuitive yet concpetual. Every painting represents a single philosophical concept, or a depiction of the cosmos - in the
        'Space Series'.</p>
      <p>Many of Alessandro's skills, including mathematics and creative coding, are channelled to one-man software projects such as the sci-fi videogame SpaceEars, which incorporates digital art, music education and Alessandro's composition.</p>
