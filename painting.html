                                         <h2>The "Space" Series: 2016-now</h2>
<p>This series focuses on reproducing imaginary or real astronomical objects, allowing for visual abstractions.</p>

                                                           <h3>Mayall's Object</h3>

                                                           <p>Mayall's Object is a unique astronomical object, thought to be the ongoing collision of two galaxies, penetrating each others. This painting, ultimated in 2018, was a gift to Brooklyn-based drummer Luke Markham, who wrote a composition called Mayall's Object. The song is also featured in Alessandro Fadini's debut album It Was A Dark And Stormy Day. The painting has been gifted to Luke Markham.</p>

                      <h2>The "Nuanced Thinking" Series: 2018</h2>
                      <p>This series projects the modus operandi of human thinking into visual abstractions. The focus is on opposing elements: coarse,ordered thought versus nuanced, creative thought.</p>
                      <h3>Nuanced Thinking #2</h3>
                                        <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking02.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking02.jpg" width="200" alt="2016  &copy; Aleks Fadini"></a></li>
<p>This is a visual representation of coarse thinking, in matte black, in juxtaposition to nuanced thinking, in purple. At the polar opposites of the canvas there is a black conceptualized element. Black is nuanced into purple, but clashes with the massive, compact blackness on the other side.</p>

   <h2>The "Neural Network" Series: 2020</h2>
   <p>This series visualizes archetypal abstract images that evoke brain cells, networks, biology.</p>
   <h3>Neural Network #3</h3>
                     <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/neuralNetwork03.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/neuralNetwork03.jpg" width="200" alt="2016  &copy; Aleks Fadini"></a></li>
<p>Acrylic and silicone on canvas. The unintellegible chaos of a network is balanced by the transparency andclarity of the material used to delineate each connectio. Reminiscent of the "space" series.</p>
