    <h2>The "Space" Series: 2016-now</h2>
    <p>This series focuses on reproducing imaginary or real astronomical objects, allowing for visual abstractions.</p>

    <h3>Mayall's Object</h3>

    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/spaceMayall.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/spaceMayall.jpg" width="200" alt="Mayall's Object (2018). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>

    <p>Mayall's Object is a unique astronomical object, thought to be the ongoing collision of two galaxies, penetrating each others. This painting, ultimated in 2018, was a gift to Brooklyn-based drummer Luke Markham, who wrote a composition called
      Mayall's Object. The song is also featured in Alessandro Fadini's debut album It Was A Dark And Stormy Day.</p>

    <h2>The "Nuanced Thinking" Series: 2018</h2>
    <p>This series projects the modus operandi of human thinking into visual abstractions. The focus is on opposing elements: coarse,ordered thought versus nuanced, creative thought.</p>
    <h3>Nuanced Thinking #2</h3>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking02.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking02.jpg" width="200" alt="Nuanced Thinking #2 (2018). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>
    <p>This is a visual representation of coarse thinking, in matte black, in juxtaposition to nuanced thinking, in purple. At the polar opposites of the canvas there is a black conceptualized element. Black is nuanced into purple, but clashes with
      the massive, compact blackness on the other side.</p>
    <h3>Other Pieces</h3>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking01.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking01.jpg" width="200" alt="Nuanced Thinking #1 (2018). 8 x 10, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking03.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/nuancedThinking03.jpg" width="200" alt="Nuanced Thinking #3 (2018). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/rationalNuances.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/rationalNuances.jpg" width="200" alt="Rational Nuances (2018). 14 x 11, acrylic and silicon on canvas."></a></li>

    <h2>The "Neural Network" Series: 2020</h2>
    <p>This series visualizes archetypal abstract images that evoke brain cells, networks, biology.</p>
    <h3>Neural Network #3</h3>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/neuralNetwork03.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/neuralNetwork03.jpg" width="200" alt="Neural Network #3 (2020). 8 x 8, acrylic and silicon on canvas."></a></li>
    <p>Acrylic and silicon on canvas. The unintellegible chaos of a network is balanced by the transparency and clarity of the material used to delineate each connection. Reminiscent of the Space Series.</p>

    <h2>The "Music Cats" Series: 2015 - Now</h2>
    <p>This series visualizes archetypal abstract images that evoke brain cells, networks, biology.</p>
    <h3>Il Basso e' Chiave (2019)</h3>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/musicIlBassoEChiave.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/musicIlBassoEChiave.jpg" width="200" alt="Il Basso e' Chiave (2019). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>
    <p>A homage to my reverence for the bass instrument, this painting proposes a fusion of two shapes: the musical glyph of the bass clef, and the shape of the acoustic bass head. It was gifted to bassist Giacomo Tagliavia in 2019.</p>
    <h3>Other Pieces</h3>

    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/musicExplosion.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/musicExplosion.jpg" width="200" alt="Music Explosion (2015). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>

    <h2>The "Pintograms" Series: 2019 - Now</h2>
    <p>This series is a study on depicting complex pilosophical concepts with simple signs and shapes.
    It is heavily influenced by the work Philographics, by Genis Carreras. Philographics was sent to me by my mother, from the other side of the ocean.</p>
    <h3>Anticausal (2019)</h3>
    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/philoAnticausal.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/philoAnticausal.jpg" width="200" alt="Anticausal (2019). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>
    <p>
      Much of science hinges on causality. Humans are able to think and act in non-causal way, and to contemplate the opposite of causality. Indeed, the most creative of all forces, Chaos, is anticausal. This is my attempt to depict the simplest anticausal visual happening.

    <li><a href="/assets/images/paintings/philoMonade.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/paintings/philoMonade.jpg" width="200" alt="Monade (2019). 8 x 8, acrylic on canvas."></a></li>
