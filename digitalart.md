# PixelPortalz, SpaceEars and Earthcore VR

I have been making digital art since I moved to New York in 2011.
Most if it takes the form of *pixelated minimalism*, an esthetic that reconnects me to my childhood, coding my first videogame on a Commodore C64 and creating sprites.
There is so much imagination in the magic that a few pixels can evoke.
This is why I created PixelPortalz, a company that promotes artistic endeavors eexpressed with digital minimalism.
I hope to show that there is depth and reflecion in digital minimalism.
I have also created pixelated worlds above the sky and under the ground, which gave rise to my to indie videogame projects
- SpaceEars (currently available on Android and iOS, a scifi roguelite game based on pitch recognition).
- Earthcore VR (currently in production, running in SteamVR, a roguelike VR game based on purely vertical VR platforming, no controls, fully roomscale).
