  <h1>PixelPortalz, SpaceEars and Earthcore VR</h1>
  <p>I have been producing digital art since I moved to New York in 2011.
    Most if it takes the form of *pixelated minimalism*, an esthetic that reconnects me to my childhood, when I coded my first videogame on a Commodore C64 and creating sprites.
    There is so much imagination in the magic that a few pixels can evoke.
    This is why I created PixelPortalz, a company that promotes artistic endeavors expressed with digital minimalism.
    I hope to show that there is depth and reflecion in digital minimalism.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have also created pixelated worlds above the sky and under the ground, which gave rise to my to indie videogame projects:
  </p>

  <p>
    - SpaceEars (currently available on Android and iOS, a scifi roguelite game based on pitch recognition).
  </p>
  <p>
    - Earthcore VR (currently in production, running in SteamVR, a roguelike VR game based on purely vertical VR platforming, no controls, fully roomscale).

    <h2>The "SpaceEars" Collection: 2019-now</h2>
    <p>This is a selection of artwork I have while imagining the game world in which SpaceEars is set.
      It is a universe of bizarre aliens and grotesque and comedic technology.
      The collection features different spaceships: the challenge is evoke nature, emotion and technology with just a very few pixels.
