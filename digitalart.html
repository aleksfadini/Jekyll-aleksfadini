  <h1>PixelPortalz, SpaceEars and Earthcore VR</h1>
  <p>I have been making digital art since I moved to New York in 2011.
    Most if it takes the form of *pixelated minimalism*, an esthetic that reconnects me to my childhood, coding my first videogame on a Commodore C64 and creating sprites.
    There is so much imagination in the magic that a few pixels can evoke.
    This is why I created PixelPortalz, a company that promotes artistic endeavors eexpressed with digital minimalism.
    I hope to show that there is depth and reflecion in digital minimalism.
    I have also created pixelated worlds above the sky and under the ground, which gave rise to my to indie videogame projects
    - SpaceEars (currently available on Android and iOS, a scifi roguelite game based on pitch recognition).
    - Earthcore VR (currently in production, running in SteamVR, a roguelike VR game based on purely vertical VR platforming, no controls, fully roomscale).

    <p>Mayall's Object is a unique astronomical object, thought to be the ongoing collision of two galaxies, penetrating each others. This painting, ultimated in 2018, was a gift to Brooklyn-based drummer Luke Markham, who wrote a composition called
      Mayall's Object. The song is also featured in Alessandro Fadini's debut album It Was A Dark And Stormy Day. The painting has been gifted to Luke Markham.</p>
